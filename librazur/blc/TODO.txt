There are so many things to do for BLC! We invite you to join us,
and participate in the development of this software.

Here are some ideas that may appear in the next version:

 - add a text-only interface in order to integrate BLC in scripts
 - add some kind of profile mechanism to save user settings
 - provide a way to add files to parse from any location (hint: URL)
 - implement drag and drop under Linux

If you can help us, don't hesitate to contact us at
librazur@gmail.com.

See you soon!
