With Librazur Jar you can easily handle jar files in your application.
With JarLauncher, you have the ability to launch a jar file in the same way
than the "java -jar" command, while handling jar dependencies.
Bootstrap goes further, and enables you to start your application with only
one jar. Moreover, you can use RestrictedClassLoader to control which
classes and resources are available through a specified ClassLoader.

Thanks for your interest in Librazur Jar.
